    <h3>A man named <span>"Big Joe Mufferaw"</span> creates a <span>Flat Earth Society</span> group in Canada. He tries to enlighten people on how and why the <span>Earth is flat</span>. He gains a lot of support from people across the world, but many people disagree with his claims and tries to use <span>violence</span> to go against him and his supporters, which causes an <span>intense worldwide war</span> between the Flat Earthers and those that don't believe the Earth is flat.</h3>
