    <h2>After the Flat Earthers won the war against those that donâ€™t believe the Earth is flat, Campbell created the <span>Flat Universe Society &nbsp</span>to enlighten people on how and why the universe is flat. His authority grew so immensely after he
      had created the Flat Universe Society, that he <span>transcended</span> beyond God's power and <span>enlightened people</span> in such a way that is so unfathomably astronomical and convincing.
